# What is Gameva?

Gameva is a platform powered by AI, designed to turn your visions into games. Think of it as game **console with infinite ideas**—not owned by corporations, but by you. It’s where gaming meets **creation, boundless potential and co-ownership.**

## At its core, Gameva is built around three principles:

### **AI-Powered Creation**

The line between "player" and "creator" disappears. With Gameva, you don’t need to code, hire a team, or even understand game design. You just need an idea—AI handles the rest. From concept to a fully playable game, the process feels almost organic.Comment

### **Ownership That Matters**

In traditional gaming, what you "own" is… not really yours. On Gameva, every game, asset, and idea you create is **yours to keep, trade, or co-op.**&#x43;omment

### **Infinite Possibilities**

There’s no ceiling here. Games don’t stop at release. With AI and community-driven innovation, they evolve, adapt, and grow. Your game could become an entire ecosystem—or a universe.

With AI as your co-creator, every moment spent with Gameva becomes an act of building. Your ideas become tangible. And gaming becomes infinite.&#x20;
