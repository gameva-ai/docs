# Mission and Vision

#### Our Mission

At Gameva, our mission is to revolutionize game creation and publishing by building a decentralized, innovative, and inclusive gaming ecosystem. Our goal is to break down the high costs, complexity, and creative restrictions present in traditional game development, enabling creators worldwide—regardless of their scale or resources—to create and publish game content on equal terms.

By integrating artificial intelligence (AI) with blockchain technology, Gameva provides powerful tools that allow creators to effortlessly transform ideas into game content while ensuring fair and transparent ownership and revenue distribution through decentralization. Our mission is to make game creation accessible not only to large corporations or well-funded teams but to every creator with a vision.

Key objectives of our mission:

* Reduce the cost of game creation and publishing, making it easier for independent developers and small teams to participate in the gaming industry.
* Foster global collaboration and creative exchange among creators through a decentralized platform.
* Incentivize creators, players, and resource providers through the GVT token reward system to drive sustainable ecosystem growth.
* Utilize blockchain technology to ensure transparency and security in intellectual property protection and revenue distribution.

#### Our Vision

* To become the leading global platform for decentralized game creation and publishing, advancing the democratization of the gaming industry.
* To provide creators with an environment free from corporate control, where they can freely express their creativity.
* To lower technical and financial barriers to game creation through AI-powered tools and intelligent support systems, making game development accessible to all.
* To enable creators, players, and community members to share in the platform’s growth and value through a decentralized reward mechanism.
* To maximize the protection of creators’ intellectual property, ensuring fair recognition and compensation for every contributor on the platform.

By pursuing this vision, Gameva aims to create a fairer, more open, and diverse gaming ecosystem—one that benefits creators and players worldwide while driving the future of the gaming industry.
