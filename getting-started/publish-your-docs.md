2. Customise and launch your game by chatting with Eva, our AI game creation agent

You can customise details such as:&#x20;

* **Name:** The official name of the game you are creating
* **Description:** A short intro about your game. This would be displayed publicly on the Gameva.Ai game library and should highlight the core gameplay, features, and unique elements
* **Character Details**: This includes the visual design of your in-game character and the personality —whether it’s friendly, mysterious, robotic, or adventurous.
* **Background Details**: The background serves as the **map and visual foundation** of your game. You can define details such as:&#x20;
  * **Design Style:** Sci-fi, fantasy, cyberpunk, minimalistic, pixel art, etc.
  * **Symbols & Icons:** Key visual elements that shape the game world, such as futuristic circuits, ancient ruins, or celestial patterns.
  * **Game Map Elements:** Terrain types, structures, landmarks, and dynamic features

* **In-Game Guide:** Offering real-time hints, tutorials, and strategic insights to help players navigate challenges.
* **Dynamic NPC:** Interacting with players, reacting to their decisions, and driving immersive storytelling.
* **Adaptive Opponent:** Challenging players with evolving strategies, learning from their gameplay, and adjusting difficulty dynamically.
* **Quest Giver:** Assigning missions, rewarding players, and providing lore to enrich the game world.
