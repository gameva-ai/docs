# What is Gameva?

Gameva is a decentralized game creation and publishing platform powered by **AI.** It is where gaming meets **creativity, boundless potential and co-ownership.** It eliminates the technical barriers of traditional game development, enabling anyone—from solo developers to global teams—to build, publish, and monetize games permissionlessly.&#x20;

Gameva is designed to turn your visions into games. It’s where gaming meets **creation, boundless potential and co-ownership.**

### At its core, Gameva is built around three principles:

### **1. AI-Powered Creation**

The line between "player" and "creator" disappears. With Gameva, you don’t need to code, hire a team, or even understand game design. Gameva allows creators to focus entirely on their creativity without getting  resistricted by coding or technical complexities. The AI acts as a co-developer, generating assets, mechanics, and even entire game worlds, making creativity boundless.

### **2. Ownership That Matters**

In traditional gaming, what you "own" is… not really yours. On Gameva, every game, asset, and idea you create is **yours to keep, trade, or co-own.**&#x20;

### **Infinite Possibilities**

There’s no ceiling here. Games don’t stop at release. With AI and community-driven innovation, they evolve, adapt, and grow. Your game could become an entire ecosystem—or a universe.

With AI as your co-creator, every moment spent with Gameva becomes an act of building. Your ideas become tangible. And gaming becomes infinite.&#x20;
