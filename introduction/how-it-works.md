#### **1. Game Creation AI**

Game **Creation** AI is an AIGC (AI-Generated Content) resource generation tool designed for game creators. It leverages large language models (LLM) to optimize user-input prompts, enabling intelligent parsing and transformation to significantly enhance both the efficiency and quality of AIGC resource generation.

**Key Features:**

* **Intelligent Prompt Parsing & Optimization:** Utilizing LLM, the system automatically interprets and enhances user descriptions, transforming them into more efficient AIGC prompts, thereby reducing learning curves and improving generation outcomes.
* **One-Click Resource Integration:** Automatically adapts generated assets to different game engines or lightweight H5/Web3 game frameworks, minimizing manual adjustments.

Game **Creation** AI helps game developers rapidly generate personalized game content, lowering barriers for art and asset creation, allowing developers to focus on gameplay and user experience innovation.

#### **2. Game** Launch **Node**

Game Launch Node provides a decentralized environment for running games across social platforms (such as Telegram, Discord, and Twitter) and lightweight H5 platforms. It integrates AI Agent nodes to enhance games with intelligent capabilities such as AI NPCs, on-chain transactions, and smart social interactions.

**Key Features:**

* **Decentralized Game Environment:** Enables games to run on browsers, social media mini-programs, and within the Web3 ecosystem without requiring additional client installations.
* **On-Chain Economic System:** Supports smart contracts, NFT trading, and on-chain asset management, allowing players to freely trade in-game assets.
* **Intelligent Social Operations:** AI Agent nodes automate game community management, allowing users to complete tasks, claim rewards, and participate in events directly within social platforms, boosting engagement.

Game Launch Node provides game developers with a flexible and scalable operating environment, enabling seamless multi-platform adaptation while enhancing gameplay and economic models with AI and blockchain technology.

#### **3. Game Portex**

Game **Portex** serves as the foundational infrastructure for Game Creation AI and Game Launch Node. It offers a high-performance and scalable game deployment platform that supports one-click game deployment and global CDN distribution, ensuring stable and efficient user access. Additionally, AI Agent standard containers facilitate the development of AI-powered game nodes, allowing developers to easily integrate AI services.

**Key Features:**

* **One-Click Game Deployment:** Supports rapid deployment of games to H5 platforms, social platforms, and the Web3 ecosystem, compatible with major engines like Cocos, Layabox, Unity, and WebGL/Three.js.
* **Modular AI Agent Deployment:** Provides modular AI Agent capabilities, enabling developers to easily integrate AI bots and intelligent assistants into their games.
* **Web3 Identity & Wallet Support:** Integrates decentralized identity (DID) systems, allowing players to access games using blockchain identities and manage assets with various Web3 wallets (e.g., MetaMask, Ton Connect).
* **Gaming Service & Bot as a Service (BaaS):** Offers community management tools that seamlessly integrate with Telegram, Discord, and other modern social platforms to enable automated user engagement, task distribution, and reward issuance.

Game Portex ensures high availability, scalability, and intelligent capabilities across the game ecosystem, providing developers with a stable and reliable technical foundation for efficient market entry and Web3 user expansion.
