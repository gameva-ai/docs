# Gameva Token Economy Model

Gameva is committed to building a decentralized, well-incentivized, and transparent gaming ecosystem. Our token, **GMV (Gameva Token)**, will serve as the core medium for all transactions, rewards, and incentives within the platform. It provides a fair value-sharing mechanism for global creators, players, strategic partners, and other ecosystem participants.

### 4. Gameva Token Buyback and Burn Mechanism

Gameva is committed to maintaining the long-term value and market stability of GMV tokens through a comprehensive buyback and burn mechanism. This mechanism combines market-driven buyback triggers, periodic buybacks, and burn measures during trading, usage, and reward phases, thereby gradually reducing the token supply and fostering a healthy ecosystem.

#### 1. Market Buyback and Burn

*   **Buyback Trigger Conditions**

    When the market price falls below a predetermined threshold or when abnormal sell orders and a sharp increase in trading volume are detected, the platform will use a portion of its revenue or reserve funds to repurchase GMV tokens on the open market.

    * **Objective**: Absorb excess liquidity, stabilize market sentiment, and demonstrate the project's confidence in the token's long-term value.
*   **Execution of Buyback and Burn**

    The GMV tokens repurchased by the platform will be permanently burned, meaning they will be removed from circulation entirely. This action directly reduces the total token supply and helps prevent inflation.

#### 2. Periodic Buyback and Burn

* **Scheduled Measures** In addition to market-triggered buybacks, Gameva will conduct regular (e.g., quarterly) buybacks using a portion of the platform’s revenue. The tokens repurchased through these periodic efforts will also be burned.
  * **Objective**: Continuously decrease the circulating supply during stable market conditions, further supporting token price stability and bolstering investor confidence.

#### 3. Transaction Fee Burn

* **Mechanism Description** Every GMV token transaction will incur a fee of 1.5%, which is automatically collected and burned by a dedicated smart contract.
  * **Objective**: By consistently burning a portion of tokens from each transaction, the mechanism gradually reduces the circulating supply, alleviating pressure from high-frequency trading.

#### 4. Usage-Based Burn

* **Mechanism Description** When users pay for platform services (e.g., game launches, resource consumption, on-chain transaction fees) with GMV tokens, a predetermined percentage of the tokens used will be burned.
  * **Objective**: This mechanism links platform activity directly to token burning, ensuring that increased usage results in a proportional decrease in supply, thereby supporting market stability.

#### 5. Staking Incentive Mechanism

* **Mechanism Description** To encourage long-term holding, the platform allows creators, resource providers, and other participants to stake a portion of their reward tokens. During the staking period, users may be exempt from certain burn fees and will receive additional staking rewards.
  * **Objective**: Reduce immediate token circulation, lower short-term selling pressure, and enhance network security and overall ecosystem stability.

#### 6. Transparent Oversight and Community Participation

*   **Public Record**

    All buyback, burn, and staking incentive activities are recorded on the blockchain, ensuring complete transparency and traceability of the entire process.
*   **Regular Reporting**

    The platform will periodically publish detailed reports on buyback and burn activities, including the quantities repurchased, the burn ratios, and the resulting market impact. This ensures that investors and community members are fully informed about the project's economic management.

***

Through these comprehensive measures, Gameva's buyback and burn mechanism is designed to reduce the circulating supply of GMV tokens gradually, counteract inflation, and maintain a stable token value over the long term. This strategy not only safeguards investor interests but also supports the sustainable growth and health of the Gameva ecosystem.

***

### **5. Presale Lock & Vesting Strategies**

To maintain market stability and ensure fair distribution, GMV tokens sold in the presale phase will follow a structured lock and vesting strategy:



* **First Presale Round**
  * **Cliff Period**: 1 month
  * **TGE Unlock**: 25%
  * **Vesting Period**: 6 months (released monthly)
* **Second Presale Round**
  * **Cliff Period**: 1 month
  * **TGE Unlock**: 20%
  * **Vesting Period**: 9 months (released monthly)
*   **Third Presale Round**

    * **Cliff Period**: 1 month
    * **TGE Unlock**: 10%
    * **Vesting Period**: 12 months (released monthly)

    ### **6. Conclusion**

    Gameva’s token economy model is designed to create a **fair, transparent, and sustainable** ecosystem through **scientific token allocation, strict lock-up and vesting policies, and continuous burn & incentive mechanisms**. This model not only incentivizes **global creators, players, and strategic partners** to actively participate in the platform’s development but also ensures that **GMV tokens maintain long-term value and controlled supply**.

    We believe this approach will drive the healthy growth of the decentralized gaming ecosystem, providing lasting innovation and shared benefits for **creators and players worldwide**.
